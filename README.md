This repository demonstrates a common error in Python: ZeroDivisionError when calculating the average of an empty list. The `bug.py` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a solution to handle this scenario gracefully.  The error occurs when the function attempts to divide by zero because the length of the empty list is zero. The solution adds a check for an empty list and returns 0 in that case.
